## Styling

To override any of the default styling of the cookie banner, we first recommend providing the `parentClass` option when initialising the cookie banner. In your own css, you can then just prefix any of the ID's we have set with the class name you just made.

```js
cookieBanner({
    parentClass: `my-cookie-banner`,
})
```

```css
/* change the bg colour of the banner to red */
.my-cookie-banner #cb-banner {
    background-color: red;
}

/* give the accept button a green bg color, black border and white text */
.my-cookie-banner #cb-accept {
    background-color: green;
    border: 2px solid black;
    color: white;
}
```
