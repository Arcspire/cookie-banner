## Demo

If you'd like to see the banner in action and some of the different ways it can be customised to suit your needs, you can do so [here](https://arcspire.github.io/cookie-banner/).

## Getting Started

1. Place the following script at the bottom of your `<body>` or if you are going to alter the styling of the banner place it above your css in your `<head>`.

```html
<script src="https://public.arcspire.io/js/cookie-banner_v0.1.0.min.js"></script>
```

2. To initialise, just call the function `cookieBanner()` with options if needed.

```js
// default
cookieBanner()
```

```js
// with options
cookieBanner({
    text: `My custom text`,
    fullScreen: true,
    // see more options below...
})
```

## Options

| Name                  | Type       | Default                                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Styling

To override any of the default styling of the cookie banner, we first recommend providing the `parentClass` option when initialising the cookie banner. In your own css, you can then just prefix any of the ID's we have set with the class name you just made.

```js
cookieBanner({
    parentClass: `my-cookie-banner`,
})
```

```css
/* change the bg colour of the banner to red */
.my-cookie-banner #cb-banner {
    background-color: red;
}

/* give the accept button a green bg color, black border and white text */
.my-cookie-banner #cb-accept {
    background-color: green;
    border: 2px solid black;
    color: white;
}
```
